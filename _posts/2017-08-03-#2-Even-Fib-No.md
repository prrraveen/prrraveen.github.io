# The Problem
Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms. By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will be:

1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ...

By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed four million, find the sum of the even-valued terms.

# Solutions
I came up with brute force solution. It exceeded range and meomory limit. 

{% highlight python %}
def solution(n):
    fib = [0] * 2
    fib[0] = fib[1] = 1
    evenSum = 0
    for i in xrange(2,n+1):
        v = fib[i-2] + fib[i-1]
        fib.append(v)
        if fib[i] > n:
            break
        if fib[i] % 2 == 0:
            evenSum += fib[i]
    return evenSum
{% endhighlight %}

[Mimino](https://www.topcoder.com/members/Mimino/) implimented it without creating fib array. Fib array isn't necessary. we can use 
two variable to hold the last two terms of fib.

{% highlight python %}
def sol(n):
    a,b,evenSum = 1, 2, 0
    while b <= n:
        if b  % 2 == 0:
            evenSum += b
        a,b = b, a+b
    return evenSum
{% endhighlight %}

Official solution document on project euler had one more optimization trick. 
odd + odd = even
odd + even = odd
even + even = even
1 1 2 3 5 8 13 21 34 55 89 144 ...

we can see that every third term is even. so we optimize which will run the 1/3 times lesser.

{% highlight python %}
def solution(n):
    a,b,evenSum = 1, 1, 0
    c = a + b
    i = 0
    while c <= n:
        i += 1
        print "i :: {0}".format(i)
        evenSum += c
        a = b+c
        b = c + a
        c = a + b
    return evenSum
{% endhighlight %}

### Time and Space Complexity
time complexity is O(n)

Project eular problems are fun.
