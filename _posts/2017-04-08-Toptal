It's draft yet.I like to publish my draft, So I know they are out there and I need to finish writing them.

Toptal conducts its algorithm test on Codility. Codility doesn't have haskell support. It just means leaving all the goodness I learn
over the year in haskell and learn to write algo in python or javascript.

Though JS and Python are equivalently bad, I choose Python for its clear syntax and data structure support. Plus its more close 
haskell then JS(even though its functional language). All the curlly braces and callbacks in Js make me sad.
