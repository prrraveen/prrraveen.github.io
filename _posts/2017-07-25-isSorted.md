# The Problem
Check is array is atmost one swap away from sorted in ascending order.

[Here is the link to the problem.](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/almost-sorted)


# Solutions

I didn't write bruteforce because I had done this problem before. But it turned out to be bad idea.

## Brute Force.
### Explaination
I solved it with bottoms up approach by writing `isSorted` first. `isSorted` itterates over the array to check if the element is bigger than the previous element. If not then array isn't sorted.

{% highlight python %}

def isSorted(A):
    temp = -sys.maxint

    for num in A:
        if num > temp:
            temp = num
        else:
            return False
    return True
    
{% endhighlight %}
The problem can be divided into two sub broblems.
* A. Try swaping and check if it sorts the array.
* B. Try reversing some subarray and check if it sorts the array.

To check if swap sorts, try swaping all the possible pairs and then call `isSorted`.
To check if reversing subarray sorts, try reversing all the possible subarrays and call `isSorted`.

{% highlight python %}
def swap(l,r):
    return """
yes
swap {0} {1}
""".format(l,r)

yes = """
yes
"""

no = """
no
"""

def rev(l,r):
    return """
yes
reverse {0} {1}
""".format(l,r)

def solution(A):
    n = len(A)
    if isSorted(A):
        return yes

    for i in xrange(n):
        for j in xrange(i+1,n):
            A[i],A[j] = A[j],A[i]
            if isSorted(A):
                return swap(i+1,j+1)
            A[j],A[i] = A[i],A[j]

    for i in xrange(n):
        for j in xrange(i+1,n):
            if isSorted(A[:i] + A[i:j][::-1] + A[j:]):
                return rev(i+1,j)
    return no
{% endhighlight %}

### Time and Space Complexity
time complexity is O(nÂ³) since there are two outer loops and isSorted takes O(n) time.

## Optimal
### Explaination
We are trying to find two elements that are out of order. Find the two number in array that make it unsorted. i.g find the first element that is smaller then its previous element. Similarly find the first element from last that is biggger than its previous element. If swaping them make the array sorted then array is atmost one swap away otherwise there are more than two element that are out of order and array can't be sorted in single swap.

If swaping doesn't sort, try reversing the subarray between these two elements (inclusive) and check if it sorts. if it is sorted then reversing it will sort the whole array.

{% highlight python %}
def solution(A):
    n = len(A)
    if isSorted(A):
        return yes
    f = None
    l = None
    temp = -sys.maxint 
    for i in xrange(n):
        if A[i] > temp:
            temp = A[i]
        else:
            f = i - 1
            break

    temp = sys.maxint
    for i in xrange(n-1,-1,-1):
        if A[i] < temp:
            temp = A[i]
        else:
            l = i + 1
            break
    if f is not None and l is not None:
        A[f],A[l] = A[l],A[f]
        if isSorted(A):
            return swap(f+1,l+1)
        A[l],A[f] = A[f],A[l]

        if isSorted(A[:f] + A[f:l+1][::-1] + A[l+1:]):
                return rev(f+1,l+1)
    return no
{% endhighlight %}

### Time and Space Complexity
time complexity is O(n)
