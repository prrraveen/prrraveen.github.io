You know a thing about traditional alarms?  They don't wake you up.
I used my phone as alarm for sometime but I it's just too easy to turn it off and go back to bed. I wanted an alarm that needs some efforts to turn it off. So I build an alarm with the Raspberry pi and an old speakers. I installed it on my bed room ceiling. It only get turn of by submitting random numbers it generates and texts me.
I used Haskell to program this. Here is the code if you like to setup your own.

import Text.InterpolatedString.Perl6 (q, qc)

main = do
    run 8080 app

app :: Application
app request respond = do
    response <- case rawPathInfo request of
                    "/" -> return indexHtml 
                    "/wake" -> wakeMeUP request
                    "/stop" -> stop
                    _ -> return fourNotFour
    respond response

indexHtml :: Response
indexHtml = responseFile
    status200
    [("Content-Type","text/html")]
    "index.html"
    Nothing

wakeMeUP :: Request -> IO Response
wakeMeUP request = do 
    let query = queryString request
    let hour = join $ lookup "hour" query
    let min  = join $ lookup "min" query
    runCommand $ job hour min
    return $ responseLBS
        status200
        [("Content-Type","text/plain")]
        "Alarm set at...to be coded later"
