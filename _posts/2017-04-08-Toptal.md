It's draft yet. I like to publish my draft, So I know they are out there and I need to finish writing them.

Toptal conducts its algorithm test on Codility. Codility doesn't have haskell support. It just means leaving all the goodness I learnt over the year and practice algo in python or javascript.

Though JS and Python are equivalently bad, I choose Python for its clear syntax and data structure support. Plus its more close 
haskell then JS(even though its functional language). All the curlly braces and callbacks in Js make me sad.

There no royal road to Algorithms either. 
TODO add udi manbers books exp.

### Common Mistakes I made.
* when working with matrix I took [[a11,a12]]. this translates well in Haskell. but it creates lot of "off by one error" while translating it in python. Rathere [[a00,a01,..]] is better.

### Things that I learnt
* Choose sufficiently large example, choose 2 or 3 examples if you are not getting anywhere with the one example.
* every part of Porblem is there for a reason. No programming problems has unncessary details. If some data is given that mean it has some connection to the solution. 

### My Approach
When I get to know a new method or data structure. I try to find an youtube video on it. Video lecture are good way to get eagle view on a toptic and if you are lucky to find a good one, It might cover a lot in depth and breaths.



### Open questions
* Codility doesn't support many library around bit array. how to solve bit manipulation problems in it?
* how does sorting works for strings with special character. is the string sorted using ASCII/unicode. how python's sorted is implimented?

### Tooling
* install code completion for vim
