It's raining here. People are leaving to office and using their cars as umbrella in traffic jams. This gives me time to solve another intresting maths
problem.

### The Problem 
Given a finite set A and a mapping f from A to itself, find a subset S âŠ† A  with the maximum number of elements, such that
* The function f maps every element of S to another element of S(i.e injective).
* No two elements of S are mapped to the same element (i.e f is one to one when restricted to S).
