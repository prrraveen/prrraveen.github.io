It is a rainy day. Here in Nice, as everywhere, people use their cars as umbrellas so the traffic jams are bigger that usual. This gives me the time to solve another math problem.

### The Problem 
Given a finite set A and a mapping f from A to itself, find a subset S âŠ† A  with the maximum number of elements, such that
* The function f maps every element of S to another element of S(i.e injective).
* No two elements of S are mapped to the same element (i.e f is one to one when restricted to S).
